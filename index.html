        <p>learn to build web appliaction and programs.Fullstack Web Development involves building both the frontend (client-side) and backend (server-side) of a web application.

Frontend (User Interface)
Built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

Frameworks like React, Angular, or Vue.js enhance interactivity.

Handles user input, displays data, and communicates with the backend.

Backend (Server & Database)
Built with languages like Node.js, Python (Django/Flask), Ruby (Rails), or PHP.

Manages business logic, authentication, and database interactions.

Uses databases like MySQL, PostgreSQL, or MongoDB for data storage.

        <div class="program-box"><h3>data science</h3>
        <p>learn how to analyze data science and build it.Data Science is the field of extracting insights from data using statistics, programming, and machine learning.

Key Components:
Data Collection & Cleaning

Gathering data from databases, APIs, or web scraping.

Handling missing values and inconsistencies.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Visualizing data (Matplotlib, Seaborn, Tableau).

Finding patterns and correlations.

Machine Learning & Modeling

Supervised (Regression, Classification) & Unsupervised (Clustering) learning.

Algorithms like Linear Regression, Decision Trees, and Neural Networks.

        <div class="program-box"><h3>artificial intelligence</h3>
        <p>AI deals with making machines,think like human.Artificial Intelligence (AI) refers to computer systems designed to perform tasks that typically require human intelligence, such as learning, reasoning, problem-solving, and decision-making. Using algorithms and vast datasets, AI can recognize patterns, automate processes, and even simulate creativity. From virtual assistants like Siri to advanced applications in healthcare, finance, and gaming, AI is transforming industries by enhancing efficiency, personalization, and innovation. While it offers immense potential, ethical concerns around bias, privacy, and job displacement remain critical challenges in its development.</p></div>
